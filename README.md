My open source projects portfolio. Built with React.


## Features

* A completely dynamic portfolio
* Filter projects by title, tags, time etc
* Responsive
* Detail view to show more information about the project
* Light weight - bundle (JS + CSS) is around 130KB without any compression
* Unmatched Awesomeness


## Dev

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

For deploying

```sh
yarn build
./deploy.sh
```

## Customizing

Edit [src/data/projects.js](src/data/projects.js) to customize the projects that are being displayed.
That file contains a simple JavaScript JSON Object so it should be very easy to get started.


## Libraries Used

```sh
React
React-Router
Redux
GeoPattern
```

## Deployment

Run `yarn build` to generate bundle files with all the dependencies.

Then use the `deploy.sh` script to deploy them to `gh-pages` branch.
